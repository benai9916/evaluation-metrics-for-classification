# evaluation-metrics-for-classification
It is very important to choose the right evaluation metric for classification models we need to check how our machine learning model is performing.

### Types of Classification evaluation metrics
We can evaluate a classification model performance using the following metrics.
1. The Confusion Matrix
  -  Classification Rate/Accuracy
  -  Misclassification Rate
  -  Sensitivity / Recall / True Positive Rate
  -  Specificity / True Negative Rate
  -  Precision / positive predictive value (PPV)
  -  False Positive Rate
2. F1 Score
3. ROC Curve â€” AUC Score
4. Log loss
